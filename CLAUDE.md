## Intro

Hey claude; We are going to be building a professional-grade and premium standard law firm website for a Law Firm called LightField Legal Practitioners that look very beautiful; sleek and professional. We will be modelling the structure after https://legaledge.co.uk while we maintain a cleaner and a more fine-grained version of the application. We will be building both the client-side and th server-side in NextJS and django/DRF respectively.
LightField LP is modern law firm that focuses on areas like emerging tech, AI and Blockchain (especially blockchain).

## Some Steps You Should take note of:

* Set up clean Python Views for actions including managing associates, blogs, etc (for the admins) - essentially CRUD operations with advanced feature the world is yet to see;
* Set Up clean models, build robust API endpoints accordingly for the application.
* The client-side should be animated professionally with Framer Motion, use beautiful yet professional SVG background patterns for some sections. Create and Make professional looking designs.
* Ensure that the pages, sections and contents are super-dynamic and Mobile responsive, offering rich experiences on any device!
* Set up clean components in @/components/{page_name}, where you should organize modular components for every page you will be working on. For components to be used across the entire app, you can simply put those ones in @/components folder.
* I need a clean folder structure by and by as you work this along.
* You will use Lucide React as the core icon library for this project.

* The publicly accessible side will also include AI-overview feature for blogs; there will also be an AI assistant called `Solo`, that will be a knowledge bank for this entire app; where you can ask it any question about the Law Firm, Associates and even some blogs without hallucinating.
* You will use Cloudinary for image uploads;


## Admin
As mentioned earlier; there will be an admin managed section for professionally creating blogs, managing associates profile info and so on.
* There will be a dedicated /admin* routes for admin users to be able to login to manage the overall application.
* The feature-rich blog creation experiences will include AI-powered assistance using the python openai SDK.
* You will create clean admin-stats for managing the overall application.
* You will implement reorder capabilities for blogs/associates for priority listing on the publicly accessible ends.


Always suggest other innovative features that could be added to the platform to improve it further.
